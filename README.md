AI French Poem Generator

This repository contains the code for an interactive web application that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to generate French poems based on user-provided topics.

Key Features:

User-friendly Interface: A simple form allows users to enter a topic for their French poem with clear instructions and examples.
AI-powered Poem Generation: Behind the scenes, the application employs an AI model trained on a dataset of French poems to create unique and creative poems. (Note: While the current code doesn't directly implement an AI model, potential integration methods are discussed in the "Future Development" section.)
Visually Appealing Design: The website boasts a clean and modern design that enhances user experience.
Prerequisites:

Basic familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be beneficial for understanding and customizing the code.
(Optional) AI Model Integration: For true AI-generated poems, an appropriate pre-trained French language model or a custom-trained model on French poetry data is necessary.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/your-username/french-poem-generator.git to download the code.
Set Up Dependencies: While the current code doesn't require external dependencies, potential AI model integration might introduce them. Refer to the specific model's documentation for installation instructions.
Run the Application: Open the index.html file in your web browser to experience the French poem generator.
Technology Stack:

HTML: The foundation of the website's structure and content.
CSS: Defines the visual styling and layout of the web page.
JavaScript: Powers the interactive elements of the form and potentially interacts with the AI model (future development).
Typewriter Effect: (Optional) Adds a visually appealing typewriter animation while the poem is generated (https://unpkg.com/typewriter-effect@latest/dist/core.js).
Axios: (Optional) Facilitates communication with an AI model if it requires making API requests (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@1.1.2/dist/axios.min.js).
Future Development:

Integrate an AI Model: Explore and integrate a suitable AI model capable of generating French poetry. Consider pre-trained language models like GPT-3 or training a custom model on French poetry data.
Enhance Functionality: Add features like poem length selection, style options (e.g., sonnet, haiku), or different poem generation methods if applicable to the chosen AI model.
Error Handling: Implement error handling to gracefully manage user input errors or potential issues with the AI model (if integrated).
